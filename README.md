# Dutch_Electricty_and_Gas

## Objective
"How does the annual gas consumption vary across different regions (based on zip codes or cities) for each provider (e.g., Liander Gas) over the years, and is there any correlation between the number of connections, type of connection, or the presence of smart meters with higher or lower consumption?"

### Tools Used

| Excel Power Pivot | Load, clean and explore the data |
|   ---              |          ---                    |
| Power BI | Visualising the data via interactive dashboards |

## Data Cleaning
Excel Power Pivot was used to combine all 150 files from kaggle and separate them into 2 different datasets, one for electricity and one for gas. Then both datasets were cleaned to remove columns, give proper data formats and check for missing values and duplicates before being imported into Power BI to create visualisations. 

## Visulisation

## Results
For electricity, the oligopoly of Stedin, Liander and Enexis made up 97% of energy consumption in the country and 91% of gas consumption. Stedin is based in the regions of Rotterdam, Arnhem and Amsterdam. Liander throughout the idle of the country and Enexis in both south and northern outskirts. All other companies have niche markets that they supply to, E.g Endurise in the South-west on the France border. 

Since 2014 there has been a noticeably downward trend in delivery percentage for all companies due to the rise of renewable energy. The lowest of which being Enexis at 84%.and the highest being Stedin at 91%. Westland Infra has the highest smart metre adoption at 37% (electricity) and 34% (gas), while Endinet has the lowest at 5% (electricity)  and 4% (gas).

For gas there has been a slight decline in gas consumption for all companies bar a few outlier years.
