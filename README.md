# Dutch_Electricty_and_Gas

## Objective
Analysis of datasets relating to energy consumption in the Netherlands from  2013 to 2018 was conducted. Excel was used to clean and analyse over a combined 8 million records before Power BI was used to create an interactive dashboard to illustrate trends and related to energy consumption, regional and provider differences and key factors. Insights and recommendations geared towards making informed decisions about promotion of new energy efficient programs, smart metre adoption and infrastructure relating to renewable energy. 

### Tools Used

| Excel Power Pivot | Load, clean and explore the data |
|   ---              |          ---                    |
| Power BI | Visualising the data via interactive dashboards |

## Data Cleaning
Excel Power Pivot was used to combine all 150 files from kaggle and separate them into 2 different datasets, one for electricity and one for gas. Then both datasets were cleaned to remove columns, give proper data formats and check for missing values and duplicates before being imported into Power BI to create visualisations. 

## Visulisation

## Results
For electricity, the oligopoly of Stedin, Liander and Enexis made up 97% of energy consumption in the country and 91% of gas consumption. Stedin is based in the regions of Rotterdam, Arnhem and Amsterdam. Liander throughout the idle of the country and Enexis in both south and northern outskirts. All other companies have niche markets that they supply to, E.g Endurise in the South-west on the France border. 

Since 2014 there has been a noticeably downward trend in delivery percentage for all companies due to the rise of renewable energy. The lowest of which being Enexis at 84%.and the highest being Stedin at 91%. Westland Infra has the highest smart metre adoption at 37% (electricity) and 34% (gas), while Endinet has the lowest at 5% (electricity)  and 4% (gas).

For gas there has been a slight decline in gas consumption for all companies bar a few outlier years. 

## Recomendation
While all stats for delivery % is down Stedin has the slowest decline of all providers. High smart metre adoption suggests openness to smarter energy use and potential market to push programs. Furthermore, very low smart metre adoption for Coteq and Endinet providers suggest push for adopting should be focused in these markets. Lastly, customers with 1x25 connections also show low adoption.
